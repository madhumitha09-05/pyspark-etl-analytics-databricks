This project demonstrates an end-to-end ETL pipeline built using Databricks and PySpark.
A raw text-based NYC taxi trips dataset is ingested, cleaned, enriched, and loaded into curated Spark tables for analytics and visualization.

The goal of this project is to showcase data engineering skills such as distributed processing, feature engineering, and SQL-based analytics on Databricks.
